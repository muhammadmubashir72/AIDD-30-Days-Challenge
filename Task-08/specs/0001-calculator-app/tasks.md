---\ndescription: \"Task list for Calculator App implementation\"\n---\n\n# Tasks: Calculator App\n\n**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/0001-calculator-app/`\n**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories)\n\n**Tests**: The feature specification does not explicitly request automated tests. Manual testing will be prioritized, but placeholder tasks for automated tests are included for future consideration.\n\n**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.\n\n## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`\n\n- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)\n- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US0, US1, US2, US3)\n- Include exact file paths in descriptions\n\n## Path Conventions\n\n- **Single project**: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, `tests/` at repository root\n\n## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)\n\n**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure\n\n- [ ] T001 Create `index.html` file at repository root\n- [ ] T002 Create `styles.css` file at repository root\n- [ ] T003 Create `script.js` file at repository root\n- [ ] T004 Create `tests/` directory for organizing test files\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)\n\n**Purpose**: Core UI structure and basic JavaScript setup that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented, including live expression display.\n\n**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete\n\n- [ ] T005 Build initial HTML layout including display, button container, and dedicated Backspace button in `index.html`\n- [ ] T006 Add basic CSS for overall layout and reset in `styles.css`\n- [ ] T007 [P] Implement CSS grid for calculator buttons in `styles.css`\n- [ ] T008 Initialize `currentInput`, `expression`, `operator`, `previousInput`, `resetDisplay` variables, and `updateDisplay` function to show full `expression` in `script.js`\n\n**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: User Story 0 - Live Expression Display (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP\n\n**Goal**: Enable users to see the full mathematical expression live on the display as it is entered.\n\n**Independent Test**: Enter numbers and operators and observe the display shows the complete expression (e.g., \"8 \* 4\").\n\n### Implementation for User Story 0\n\n- [ ] T009 [P] [US0] Update number and decimal button event listeners to append to `expression` string in `script.js`\n- [ ] T010 [P] [US0] Update operator button event listeners to append operator to `expression` string in `script.js`\n\n**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 0 should be fully functional and testable independently\n\n---\n\n## Phase 4: User Story 1 - Basic Arithmetic (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP\n\n**Goal**: Enable users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n**Independent Test**: Perform basic arithmetic operations and verify results after the full expression is shown.\n\n### Implementation for User Story 1\n\n- [ ] T011 [US1] Implement core arithmetic functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) to evaluate `expression` in `script.js`\n- [ ] T012 [US1] Implement equals button event listener and calculation logic to evaluate `expression` and update display in `script.js`\n\n**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently\n\n---\n\n## Phase 5: User Story 2 - Decimal Operations (Priority: P1)\n\n**Goal**: Allow calculations with decimal numbers and prevent multiple decimals.\n\n**Independent Test**: Perform operations with decimal numbers and attempt to input multiple decimals.\n\n### Implementation for User Story 2\n\n- [ ] T013 [US2] Enhance input logic to handle decimal point input within the `expression` in `script.js`\n- [ ] T014 [US2] Implement logic to prevent multiple decimal points in a single number within the `expression` in `script.js`\n\n**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 0, 1 AND 2 should both work independently\n\n---\n\n## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Clear and Backspace (Priority: P1)\n\n**Goal**: Provide functionality to clear the display and delete the last digit/character.\n\n**Independent Test**: Use Clear and Backspace buttons to manipulate display.\n\n### Implementation for User Story 4\n\n- [ ] T015 [P] [US4] Add \'Clear\' button event listener and logic to purely reset calculator state (clear `expression`) in `script.js`\n- [ ] T016 [P] [US4] Add \'Backspace\' button event listener and logic to remove last character from `expression` in `script.js`\n\n**Checkpoint**: All user stories up to this point should now be independently functional\n\n---\n\n## Phase 7: User Story 3 - Chaining Operations (Priority: P2)\n\n**Goal**: Enable users to perform continuous operations without intermediate \'equals\' presses.\n\n**Independent Test**: Perform a sequence of operations like \"2 + 3 \* 4 =\" and verify the result.\n\n### Implementation for User Story 3\n\n- [ ] T017 [US3] Modify operator logic to immediately calculate previous operation when a new operator is pressed, updating `expression` in `script.js`\n\n**Checkpoint**: All user stories up to this point should now be independently functional\n\n---\n\n## Phase 8: User Story 5 - Percent and Plus/Minus (Priority: P2)\n\n**Goal**: Implement percentage calculations and sign toggling.\n\n**Independent Test**: Apply percent and plus/minus to numbers.\n\n### Implementation for User Story 5\n\n- [ ] T018 [P] [US5] Add \'Percent\' button event listener and logic to modify `expression` in `script.js`\n- [ ] T019 [P] [US5] Add \'Plus/Minus\' button event listener and logic to toggle sign in `script.js`\n\n**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional\n\n---\n\n## Phase 9: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\n\n**Purpose**: Final improvements and comprehensive testing.\n\n- [ ] T020 Implement keyboard support for number, operator, and special keys, updating `expression` in `script.js`\n- [ ] T021 Conduct comprehensive manual testing of all user stories and edge cases\n- [ ] T022 (Optional) Add unit tests for `script.js` arithmetic and logic functions in `tests/unit/calculator.test.js`\n- [ ] T023 (Optional) Add integration tests for UI interactions in `tests/integration/ui.test.js`\n- [ ] T024 Review and refine CSS for responsiveness and visual consistency in `styles.css`\n- [ ] T025 Final code cleanup, comments, and documentation for `script.js`, `index.html`, `styles.css`\n\n---\n\n## Dependencies & Execution Order\n\n### Phase Dependencies\n\n- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately\n- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories\n- **User Story 0 (Phase 3 - Live Expression Display)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion - BLOCKS all other user stories\n- **User Stories (Phase 4+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion and US0 completion.\n  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed) or sequentially in priority order.\n- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete\n\n### User Story Dependencies\n\n- **User Story 0 (P1 - Live Expression Display)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories for its core display logic.\n- **User Story 1 (P1 - Basic Arithmetic)**: Can start after US0 (Phase 3) - Depends on US0 for displaying the expression.\n- **User Story 2 (P1 - Decimal Operations)**: Can start after US0 (Phase 3) - Depends on US0 for displaying the expression and US1 for core arithmetic.\n- **User Story 4 (P1 - Clear and Backspace)**: Can start after US0 (Phase 3) - Depends on US0 for manipulating the displayed expression.\n- **User Story 3 (P2 - Chaining Operations)**: Can start after US0 (Phase 3) - Depends on US0 for displaying the expression and US1 for core arithmetic.\n- **User Story 5 (P2 - Percent and Plus/Minus)**: Can start after US0 (Phase 3) - Depends on US0 for displaying the expression and US1 for core arithmetic.\n\n### Within Each User Story\n\n- Event listeners before core logic where applicable\n- Core implementation before integration\n- Story complete before moving to next priority\n\n### Parallel Opportunities\n\n- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Task T007 (CSS grid) can run in parallel within Phase 2\n- Tasks T009 and T010 can run in parallel within Phase 3 (US0)\n- User Stories 1, 2, 4, 3, 5 can conceptually be worked on in parallel by different team members *after* the Foundational and US0 phases, but dependencies exist for core arithmetic.\n- Tasks T015 and T016 can run in parallel within Phase 6 (US4).\n- Tasks T018 and T019 can run in parallel within Phase 8 (US5).\n\n---\n\n## Parallel Example: User Story 0\n\n```bash\n# Launch all parallel tasks for User Story 0 together:\nTask: \"Update number and decimal button event listeners to append to `expression` string in `script.js`\"\nTask: \"Update operator button event listeners to append operator to `expression` string in `script.js`\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### MVP First (User Stories 0, 1, 2, 4 Only)\n\n1. Complete Phase 1: Setup\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 0 (Live Expression Display) - *New MVP requirement*\n4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 1 (Basic Arithmetic)\n5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 2 (Decimal Operations)\n6. Complete Phase 6: User Story 4 (Clear and Backspace)\n7. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Stories 0, 1, 2, and 4 independently\n\n### Incremental Delivery\n\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\n2. Add User Story 0 → Test independently\n3. Add User Story 1 → Test independently\n4. Add User Story 2 → Test independently\n5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently\n6. Add User Story 3 → Test independently\n7. Add User Story 5 → Test independently\n8. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\n\n### Parallel Team Strategy\n\nWith multiple developers (after Foundational and US0 phases):\n\n- Developer A: User Story 1 (Basic Arithmetic)\n- Developer B: User Story 2 (Decimal Operations)\n- Developer C: User Story 4 (Clear and Backspace)\n- Developer D: User Story 3 (Chaining Operations)\n- Developer E: User Story 5 (Percent and Plus/Minus)\n\nIndividual stories can be completed and integrated, with careful attention to dependencies on core expression building and arithmetic functions.\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable where possible.\n- Verify manual tests pass after each user story implementation.\n- Commit after each task or logical group.\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently.\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence.\n
