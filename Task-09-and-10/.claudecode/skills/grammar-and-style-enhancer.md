# Grammar and Style Enhancer

## Skill Name
Grammar and Style Enhancer

## Purpose
Improves the grammar, sentence structure, and writing style of text to make it clearer and more engaging for readers.

## How It Works
Analyzes text for grammar errors, awkward phrasing, and style issues, then suggests improvements while maintaining the original meaning and voice.

## Input Example
```
Original text: "The dog ran quick to the store. He was needing to get food for his family. The store was closed when he got there."
Target style: Academic writing
Tone: Formal
```

## Output Example
```
Enhanced text: "The individual hurried swiftly toward the establishment. He required provisions for his household. Upon his arrival, he discovered that the store had already closed for the day."

Alternative version: "The man rushed to the store to purchase groceries for his family, only to find it had already closed."

Grammar corrections made:
- Changed "ran quick" to "hurried swiftly" (adverb usage)
- Improved "was needing" to "required" (tense consistency)
- Enhanced "got there" to "arrived" (formal language)
- Combined short sentences for better flow
