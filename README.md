# 🧠 AIDD 30-Day Challenge  
AI-Driven Development Learning Journey

Welcome to my 30-Day AIDD (AI-Driven Development) Challenge.  
This repository will document my complete learning journey as I explore the AI-Native Era, Agentic AI, Evaluation-Driven Development, TDD, and modern AI-assisted development workflows.

Each day includes a new activity, reflection, practice task, and key concepts.  
The goal of this challenge is to understand how developers collaborate with AI and how software development is evolving in the AI-native world.
